# sd-wildcard-editor

## Structure
**sd-wildcard-editor** works on a "project basis". Every project represents a collection of different wildcards, and each project also serves as a combination of all that project's wildcards.

A project can also contain other projects, in which case, the project's combination wildcard will be used.
